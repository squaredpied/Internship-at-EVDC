# Speed-of-Sound
# Speed-of-Sound
This project is to measure the speed of sound. In order to achieve this, two KY-037 sound sensors will be placed on a
leveled ground and kept in different places.

The distance between the two sound sensors will then be measured.

Working principle:
The python code called timer.py in the repository will be executed. A clap or a loud bang will be made in front of one of the sound sensors. When the clap is made,
the timer starts. The other sound sensor will stop the timer when the sound reaches it. Please note that the microphone of the two sound sensors should be facing
each other for the experiment to work.

Since we have the distance between the sound sensors and the time it takes for sound to travel from the first sound sensor to the other one, the speed of sound
can be calculated.
This can be done by dividing the distance by the time (secs). Be careful of the unit used for measuring the distance.

Also, for this project, a platform was manufactured to hold the two sound sensors. The SolidWorks part file of this structure can be seen in this repository.
The aim of this project was to practically demonstrate how the speed of sound can be obtained.
